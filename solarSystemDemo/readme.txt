This is a small project I did in summer 2018 after I finished openGL subject provided in university.
The program simulates a simple solar system with main planets and asteroids.

Main tecniques used in the program:
1.texture mapping
2.GLSL shader program
3.multi-camera


User input:
1.hold right mouse button to rotate camera.
2.W,S,A,D key to control movement.
3.escape key to exit program.


GUI:
I used antweakbar as user interface. By clicking icon on GUI, user can control the following:
1.by clicking "wireframe", user can toggle between wireframe mode and full-rendering mode.
2.by clicking "animation", user can toggle between animation mode and still mode.
3.by clicking "top view", user can toggle between top view and perspective view.
